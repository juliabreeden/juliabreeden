## Hi, I’m Julia!

I’m a software engineer who enjoys working with others to solve interesting problems. I mostly work in the JavaScript ecosystem and care a lot about building maintainable, human-centered software that improves people’s lives.

### ✍️ Writing
I write about engineering, debugging, and how my thinking about software evolves:
